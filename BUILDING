<<Development Purposes>>

<How to build the application locally>

	Prerequisites:

		- This application runs on Ethereum, so you must have an Ethereum Account to enable transactions. For local development purposes, you must have a truffle suite such as Ganache in order to run the application. Refer to the following link for Ganache: 

			https://github.com/trufflesuite/Ganache

		You must have your Ganache account open to migrate your contract.

		- On Online Ethereum Wallet is necessary to make transactions via web. Chrome Extensions such as MetaMask is required. Refer to the following link for MetaMask:

			https://metamask.io/

	
	1. Download all packages for npm:

		npm install


	2. Check the contract before deploying using a test file:

		truffle test


	3. Migrate your contract. This will consume gas:

		truffle migrate --reset


	4. After migrating your contract, run the application:

		npm run start


	5. Access your application using:

		localhost:3000


	6. Log into the application using your MetaMask confidential information(Directed to localhost:7545).
